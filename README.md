# Project 1 | Pandas.

## Requirements/Libraries Used:
This code was written in Python/Jupyter Notebook, using the following libraries:

*Numpy
*Pandas
*matplotlib.pyplot 
*Seaborn
*re
*datetime
*geonamescache

## Hypotheses: 
1- Are there countries more prone to shark attacks?

2- What shark species are more dangerous?

3- Do they typically attack humans?

4- Could there be activities more prone to attacks?


## Overview

This project aims to prepare a set of data about shark attacks by removing irrelevant information, handling missing information, and correcting the data type of the columns. The cleaned and formatted data will be used to create visual representations that will either confirm or disprove my theories.

Progress has been made by obtaining the dataset and beginning the cleaning and formatting process. The dataset was analyzed to identify the distribution of variables, patterns, and correlations. Based on the analysis, I have developed theories which will be tested using selected statistical tests.

Next, statistical tests will be conducted, and the results will be used to create visualizations which will accurately communicate the findings to relevant parties.
