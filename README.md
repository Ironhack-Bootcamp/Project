# Project I | Pandas

## Overview

This project aims to prepare a set of data about shark attacks by removing irrelevant information, handling missing information, and correcting the data type of the columns. The cleaned and formatted data will be used to create visual representations that will either confirm or disprove my theories.

Progress has been made by obtaining the dataset and beginning the cleaning and formatting process. The dataset was analyzed to identify the distribution of variables, patterns, and correlations. Based on the analysis, I have developed hipothesis which will be tested using selected statistical tests.

Next, statistical tests will be conducted, and the results will be used to create visualizations which will accurately communicate the findings to relevant parties. 

## Requirements/Libraries Used:
This code was written in Python/Jupyter Notebook, using the following libraries:

*Numpy

*Pandas

*matplotlib.pyplot 

*Seaborn

*re

*datetime

*geonamescache

## Hypotheses: 
1- Certain countries exhibit a higher susceptibility to shark attacks than others

2- The risk level associated with different shark species

3- The tendency of sharks to attack humans

4- It is possible that specific human activities are at a higher risk of shark attacks.

## Analysis

# 1- Certain countries exhibit a higher susceptibility to shark attacks than others

The data clearly indicates that certain countries are more susceptible to shark attacks, and this susceptibility is believed to be the result of a complex interplay of geographical factors, climatic conditions, and human activities in coastal regions

# 2- The risk level associated with different shark species

This data suggests that some shark species pose a potentially higher risk to humans than others. The fatality rates associated with these species raise concerns about their potential danger to human swimmers, divers, and beachgoers.

# 3- The tendency of sharks to attack humans

Some shark species demonstrate a higher propensity for attacking humans than others. This could be influenced by factors such as the species' behavior, habitat, and feeding preferences.

# 4- It is possible that specific human activities are at a higher risk of shark attacks.

Some aquatic activities are riskier than others due to factors such as the presence of potential prey, water conditions, and human behaviors. To keep safe in areas where shark encounters are common, it's important to get a better understanding of these activities and their connection to shark attacks.

# Conclusion

Certain countries are more prone to shark attacks due to geography, climate, and human activities. Some shark species are more dangerous to humans based on their fatality rates. Certain water activities carry higher risk due to factors like prey, water conditions, and human behavior. Understanding these risks is crucial to enhance safety in areas where shark encounters are common.
